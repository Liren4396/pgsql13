# COMP3311 20T3 Final Exam Q12

(a)
Conflict on X, T2 -> T1
Conflict on X, T1 -> T2, T1-> T3, T2 -> T3

Cycle in precedence graph
=> not conflict serializable


(b)
Consider serial schedule T2;T1;T3

For X
- nobody does initial read
- T3 does the final write
For Y
- T2 does initial read
- T1 does final write

The concurrent schedule has the same properties
=> view serializable
